# Welcome to BaseTheme Demo

A demonstration site built using [BaseTheme](https://github.com/ChristopherA/BaseTheme) - a minimal Jekyll remote theme for GitHub Pages. While BaseTheme provides a lean foundation, this demo site shows you how to build upon that foundation for both simple web pages and optional features like blogs.

Think of BaseTheme as your starting point - a foundational building block. This demo site shows you how to add additional blocks together for a complete lean website, whether you need:
- 🪶 Basic web pages with clean navigation
- 📝 Blog posts with proper formatting
- 🔍 SEO-friendly metadata
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design
- 🌙 Dark mode support
- 🖨️ Print-friendly styles
- 🎨 Easy customization options
- 🚫 No JavaScript requirements
